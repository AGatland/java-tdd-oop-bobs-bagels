As the manager,
So we don't get any weird requests,
I want customers to only be able to order things that we stock in our inventory.
```
#### Inventory class implemented

## Extension 1
```
As the manager,
To hype up our restaurant and draw in more customers,
I want to implement discounts for some bulk and combo buys.
```
#### Implement Discounts and Discount interface, implemented by BulkDiscount and ComboDiscount
```
Assumptions:
 - There is only a maximum of one type of discount for each specific product
 - The combo discount is for one specific product in combination with another type of product
 - The combo discount can include products already part of a bulk discount
 - The combo discount uses the lowest cost product of the other type it combines with
```
| Discounts           |
|---------------------|
| List<Discount>      |
| Inventory inventory |

| Discount      |
|---------------|
| sku: String   |
| price: double |

| BulkDiscount  |
|---------------|
| sku: String   |
| number: int   |
| price: double |

| ComboDiscount |
|---------------|
| sku: String   |
| name: String  |
| price: double |
```
As a customer,
So I know how much money I need,
I'd like to know what the total cost of items in my basket will be after the discounts are added in.
